TwitchKat
=========

TwitchKat allows you to watch Twitch streams on Android KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow (and possibly
older versions, I haven't checked).

TwitchKat is just a web view that opens the Twitch desktop site. I've made this app because the
official Twitch app has stoped supporting on Android 6 and below and its old versions also don't
work anymore because of the new captcha verification step during login.
